# Deploying to Dokku

## Deploy tutorial

Once Dokku has been configured with at least one user, applications can be deployed via a `git push` command. To quickly see Dokku deployment in action, you can use the Heroku Ruby on Rails example app.

```shell
# from your local machine
# SSH access to github must be enabled on this host
git clone git@github.com:heroku/ruby-rails-sample.git
```

### Create the app

Create the application on the Dokku host. You will need to ssh onto the host to run this command.

```shell
# on your Dokku host
dokku apps:create ruby-rails-sample
```

### Create the backing services

When you create a new app, Dokku by default *does not* provide any datastores such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. You will need to install plugins to handle that, but fortunately [Dokku has official plugins](/docs/community/plugins.md#official-plugins-beta) for common datastores. Our sample app requires a PostgreSQL service:

```shell
# on your Dokku host
# install the postgres plugin
# plugin installation requires root, hence the user change
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git

# create a postgres service with the name rails-database
dokku postgres:create rails-database
```

> Each service may take a few moments to create.

### Linking backing services to applications

Once the service creation is complete, set the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable by linking the service.

```shell
# on your Dokku host
# each official datastore offers a `link` method to link a service to any application
dokku postgres:link rails-database ruby-rails-sample
```

> You can link a single service to multiple applications or use one service per application.

### Deploy the app

Now you can deploy the `ruby-rails-sample` app to your Dokku server. All you have to do is add a remote to name the app. Applications are created on-the-fly on the Dokku server.

```shell
# from your local machine
# the remote username *must* be dokku or pushes will fail
cd ruby-rails-sample
git remote add dokku dokku@dokku.me:ruby-rails-sample
git push dokku master
```

> Note: Some tools may not support the short-upstream syntax referenced above, and you may need to prefix
> the upstream with the scheme `ssh://` like so: `ssh://dokku@dokku.me:ruby-rails-sample`
> Please see the [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls_a_id_urls_a) documentation for more details.

=====> Application deployed:
       http://ruby-rails-sample.dokku.me
```

When the deploy finishes, the application's URL will be shown as seen above.

Dokku supports deploying applications via [Heroku buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) with [Herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish#buildpacks) or using a project's [dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/).


### Deploying non-master branch

Dokku only supports deploying from its master branch, so if you'd like to deploy a different local branch use: ```git push dokku <local branch>:master```

An alternative is to use the `DOKKU_DEPLOY_BRANCH` application config value to specify a branch that should be deployed. The implicit default is master, and this can be modified both at the app and global level:

```shell
# on your Dokku host

# set it globally
dokku config:set --global DOKKU_DEPLOY_BRANCH=some-branch

# override for a specific app
dokku config:set ruby-rails-sample DOKKU_DEPLOY_BRANCH=some-branch
```

You can also support pushing multiple branches using the [receive-branch](/docs/development/plugin-triggers.md#receive-branch) plugin trigger in a custom plugin.

### Skipping deployment

If you only want to rebuild and tag a container, you can skip the deployment phase by setting `$DOKKU_SKIP_DEPLOY` to `true` by running:

``` shell
# on your Dokku host
dokku config:set ruby-rails-sample DOKKU_SKIP_DEPLOY=true
```

### Re-Deploying / restarting

If you need to re-deploy (or restart) your app: 

```shell
# on your Dokku host
dokku ps:rebuild ruby-rails-sample
```

See the [process scaling documentation](/docs/deployment/process-management.md) for more information.

### Deploying with private git submodules

Dokku uses git locally (i.e. not a docker image) to build its own copy of your app repo, including submodules. This is done as the `dokku` user. Therefore, in order to deploy private git submodules, you'll need to drop your deploy key in `/home/dokku/.ssh/` and potentially add github.com (or your VCS host key) into `/home/dokku/.ssh/known_hosts`. The following test should help confirm you've done it correctly.

```shell
# on your Dokku host
su - dokku
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Note that if the buildpack or dockerfile build process require ssh key access for other reasons, the above may not always apply.

## Deploying to subdomains

The name of remote repository is used as the name of application to be deployed, as for example above:

```shell
# from your local machine
# the remote username *must* be dokku or pushes will fail
git remote add dokku dokku@dokku.me:ruby-rails-sample
git push dokku master
```

```
remote: -----> Application deployed:
remote:        http://ruby-rails-sample.dokku.me
```

You can also specify fully qualified names, say `app.dokku.me`, as

```shell
# from your local machine
# the remote username *must* be dokku or pushes will fail
git remote add dokku dokku@dokku.me:app.dokku.me
git push dokku master
```

```
remote: -----> Application deployed:
remote:        http://app.dokku.me
```

This is in particular useful, then you want to deploy to root domain, as

```shell
# from your local machine
# the remote username *must* be dokku or pushes will fail
git remote add dokku dokku@dokku.me:dokku.me
git push dokku master
```

    ... deployment ...

    remote: -----> Application deployed:
    remote:        http://dokku.me

## Dokku/Docker Container Management Compatibility

Dokku is, at its core, a docker container manager. Thus, it does not necessarily play well with other out-of-band processes interacting with the docker daemon. One thing to note as in [issue #1220](https://github.com/dokku/dokku/issues/1220), dokku executes a cleanup function prior to every deployment.

As of 0.5.x, this function removes all containers with the label `dokku` where the status is either `dead` or `exited`, as well as all `dangling` images. Previous versions would remove `dead` or `exited` containers, regardless of their label.

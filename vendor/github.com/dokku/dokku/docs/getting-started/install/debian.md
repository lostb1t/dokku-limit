# Debian Package Installation Notes

As of 0.3.18, Dokku defaults to being installed via debian package. While certain hosts may require extra work to get running, you may optionally wish to automate the installation of Dokku without the use of our `bootstrap.sh` bash script. The following are the steps run by said script:

```shell
# install prerequisites
sudo apt-get update -qq > /dev/null
sudo apt-get install -qq -y apt-transport-https

# install docker
wget -nv -O - https://get.docker.com/ | sh

# install dokku
wget -nv -O - https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/dokku/dokku/ubuntu/ trusty main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dokku.list
sudo apt-get update -qq > /dev/null
sudo apt-get install -qq -y dokku
sudo dokku plugin:install-dependencies --core
```

## Unattended installation

In case you want to perform an unattended installation of dokku, this is made possible through [debconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debconf_%28software_package%29), which allows you to configure a package before installing it.

You can set any of the below options through the `debconf-set-selections` command, for example to enable vhost-based deployments:

```bash
echo "dokku dokku/vhost_enable boolean true" | sudo debconf-set-selections
```

After setting the desired options, proceed with the installation as described above.

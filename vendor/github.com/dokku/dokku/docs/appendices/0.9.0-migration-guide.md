# 0.9.0 Migration Guide

## Golang Migration

There is an ongoing migration to rewrite Dokku in Golang. The reasons are beyond the scope of this document, but this may impact any patches you have for Dokku. As of 0.9.0, only the `repo` plugin is in Golang.

The following shall remain true, regardless of the state of our rewrite:

- You will be able to write custom plugins in any language.
- You will be able to enable or disable core plugins.
- `plugn` will continue to be used for executing plugin triggers.
- We will provide bash wrappers that can be sourced to execute core functionality that is implemented in golang.

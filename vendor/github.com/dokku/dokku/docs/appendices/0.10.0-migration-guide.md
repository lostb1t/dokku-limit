# 0.10.0 Migration Guide

## PCI Compliance

By default, Dokku will ship a PCI Compliant nginx configuration. For developers whose users are on older browsers or mobile devices, you may need to ship a custom `nginx.conf.sigil` to enable ciphers for older browsers.

See the [nginx customization](/docs/configuration/nginx/#customizing-the-nginx-configuration) docs for more details.

## Nginx Error Pages

We now ship with nicer error pages by default. You are free to customize your Dokku installation via a custom `nginx.conf.sigil` to change what error pages are displayed in different circumstances.

See the [nginx customization](/docs/configuration/nginx/#customizing-the-nginx-configuration) docs for more details.
